name: Workbook of 2-dimensional geometries
description: We will first explore the properties of euclidean, or flat, 2-dimensional geometry you learned in secondary school and in calculus.  We will then learn how to navigate in the other 2-dimensional geometries, namely spherical, or positively curved geometry, and finally hyperbolic, or negatively curved, geometry.
