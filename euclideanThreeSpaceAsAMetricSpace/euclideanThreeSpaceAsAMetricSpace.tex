\subsection*{Points and vectors in euclidean 3-space}

In this book, we will study all the \textit{two}-dimensional
geometries (spheres, the plane and hyperbolic spaces). Each one of
these geometries looks the same at each of its points and it also
looks the same in every direction emanating from any of its
points. But to study them all at the same time and in a uniform way we
will need to visualize them all as different surfaces lying in some
common \textit{three}-dimensional space. Let's examine this
``ambient'' space.


For those we begin with three-dimensional euclidean space%
\[
\mathbb{R}^{3}=\left\{  \left(  \hat{x},\hat{y},\hat{z}\right)  :\hat{x}%
,\hat{y},\hat{z}\in\mathbb{R}\right\}.
\]
We will want to reserve the notation $\left( x,y,z\right) $ for some
new coordinates that we will put on the `same' objects in the next
section. In euclidean space, there is a standard way to measure distance between two points%
\begin{align*}
\hat{X}_{1}  &  =\left(  \hat{x}_{1},\hat{y}_{1},\hat{z}_{1}\right) \\
\hat{X}_{2}  &  =\left(  \hat{x}_{2},\hat{y}_{2},\hat{z}_{2}\right)  ,
\end{align*}
namely%
\begin{equation}
d\left(  \hat{X}_{1},\hat{X}_{2}\right)  =\sqrt{\left(  \hat{x}_{2}-\hat
{x}_{1}\right)  ^{2}+\left(  \hat{y}_{2}-\hat{y}_{1}\right)  ^{2}+\left(
\hat{z}_{2}-\hat{z}_{1}\right)  ^{2}}. \label{0}%
\end{equation}

When you see $\left( \hat{x},\hat{y},\hat{z}\right)$ in what follows,
that means that distance between points is measured by the formula
above. One more thing, in euclidean three-space it
will be important throughout to make the distinction between
\textbf{points} and \textbf{vectors}: Although each will be
represented by a triple of real numbers we will use%
\[
\hat{X}=\left(  \hat{x},\hat{y},\hat{z}\right)
\]
to denote \textbf{points}, that is, \textbf{position} in euclidean $3$-space,
and%
\[
\hat{V}=\left(  \hat{a},\hat{b},\hat{c}\right)
\]
to denote \textbf{vectors}, that is, \textbf{displacement} by which we mean
the amount and direction a given point is being moved. So vectors always
indicate \textit{motion} from an explicit (or implicit) \textit{point} of
reference. 

\subsection*{The dot product determines length, angle, and area}

There are various operations we can perform on one or more vectors when we
think of them as emanating from the same point in euclidean $3$-space. The
first is the dot product of two vectors.

\begin{definition}
The dot product of two vectors%
\begin{align*}
\hat{V}_{1}  &  =\left(  \hat{a}_{1},\hat{b}_{1},\hat{c}_{1}\right) \\
\hat{V}_{2}  &  =\left(  \hat{a}_{2},\hat{b}_{2},\hat{c}_{2}\right)
\end{align*}
emanating from the same point in 3-dimensional euclidean space is
defined as the real number given by the formula%
\[
\hat{a}_{1}\hat{a}_{2}+\hat{b}_{1}\hat{b}_{2}+\hat{c}_{1}\hat{c}_{2}%
\]
or in matrix notation as%
\[
\begin{bmatrix}
\hat{a}_{1} & \hat{b}_{1} & \hat{c}_{1}%
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
\hat{a}_{2}\\
\hat{b}_{2}\\
\hat{c}_{2}%
\end{bmatrix}.
\]
It is also denoted as%
\[
\hat{V}_{1}\bullet\hat{V}_{2}%
\]
or in matrix notation as%
\[
\hat{V}_{1}\cdot \hat{V}_{2}^\transpose.
\]

\end{definition}

\begin{problem}
Give the formula for the length $\left\vert \hat{V}\right\vert $ of a vector
$\hat{V}=\left(  \hat{a},\hat{b},\hat{c}\right)  $ in 3-dimensional euclidean
space in terms of dot product.
\end{problem}


\begin{lemma}[Law of Cosines]
\label{110} The (smaller) angle $\theta$ between two
vectors $\hat{V}_{1}$ and $\hat{V}_{2}$ emanating from $O=\left(
0,0,0\right)  $ satisfies the relation%
\[
\left\vert \hat{V}_{2}-\hat{V}_{1}\right\vert ^{2}=\left\vert \hat{V}%
_{1}\right\vert ^{2}+\left\vert \hat{V}_{2}\right\vert ^{2}-2\left\vert
\hat{V}_{1}\right\vert \cdot\left\vert \hat{V}_{2}\right\vert \cdot
\cos\theta.
\]
\end{lemma}

Now we will prove this lemma. Your task is to fill-in the details of
the proof below.

\begin{problem}
Start by noting that without loss of generality we can assume that
$\left\vert \hat{V}% _{1}\right\vert \leq\left\vert
\hat{V}_{2}\right\vert$. Consider the triangle with one side given by
the segment from $O=\left( 0,0,0\right) $ to the endpoint $P_{1}$ of
$\hat{V}_{1}$, with a second side $S_{2}$ given by the segment from
$O$ to the endpoint $P_{2}$ of $\hat{V}_{2}$ and with the third side
given by the segment joining $P_{1}$ and $P_{2}$. Let $P$ be the
point on $S_{2}$ so that the segment between $P_{1}$ and $P$ is
perpendicular to $S_{2}$.
\begin{itemize}
\item Illustrate the diagram described above. 
\item Now explain how the Pythagorean theorem gives:
\begin{align*}
|P_{1}P_{2}|^{2} - |P_{2}P|^{2} &= |PP_{1}|^{2}\\
&= |OP_{1}|^{2} - |OP|^{2}\\
\end{align*}
\item Explain the following lines:
\begin{align*}
|P_{1}P_{2}|^{2} &= |OP_{1}|^{2}+\left(|P_{2}P|^{2}-|OP|^{2}\right) \\
&=|OP_{1}|^{2}+\left(|P_{2}P|+|OP|\right)\left(|P_{2}P|-|OP| \right)
\end{align*}
\item Explain the following lines:
\begin{align*}
&=|OP_{1}|^{2}+|OP_{2}| \left(|P_{2}P|-|OP|\right)\\
&=|OP_{1}|^{2}+|OP_{2}| \left(|OP_{2}| -2| OP| \right)
\end{align*}
\item Now consider,
\[
|OP| =|OP_{1}| \cdot\cos\theta.
\]
and explain how this completes the proof.
\end{itemize}
\end{problem}



%% \begin{problem}
%% What can you say about the cosine of the larger of the two angles between two
%% vectors $\hat{V}_{1}$ and $\hat{V}_{2}$, that is about $\left(  360^{\circ
%% }-\theta\right)  $?
%% \end{problem}

\begin{theorem}
\label{111}The angle $\theta$ between two vectors $\hat{V}_{1}$ and
$\hat{V}_{2}$ emanating from the same point in euclidean $3$-space satisfies
the relation
\begin{equation}
\hat{V}_{1}\bullet\hat{V}_{2}=\left\vert \hat{V}_{1}\right\vert \cdot
\left\vert \hat{V}_{2}\right\vert \cdot\cos\theta. \label{2}%
\end{equation}
[DS,30ff]
\end{theorem}

Now we will prove this theorem. Your task is to fill-in the details of
the proof below.

\begin{problem}
Multiplying out using the definition and algebraic properties of dot product,%
\begin{align*}
\left\vert \hat{V}_{2}-\hat{V}_{1}\right\vert ^{2}  &  =\left(  \hat{V}%
_{2}-\hat{V}_{1}\right)  \bullet\left(  \hat{V}_{2}-\hat{V}_{1}\right) \\
&  =\left\vert \hat{V}_{1}\right\vert ^{2}+\left\vert \hat{V}_{2}\right\vert
^{2}-2\left(  \hat{V}_{1}\bullet\hat{V}_{2}\right)  .
\end{align*}
Now apply the previous lemma.

Explain how this proves the theorem. 
\end{problem}

The significance of the theorem above is that the measure of angles between
vectors depends only on the definition of the dot product.

\begin{corollary}
The formula for the angle $\theta$ between two vectors $\hat{V}_{1}=\left(
\hat{a}_{1},\hat{b}_{1},\hat{c}_{1}\right)  $ and $\hat{V}_{2}=\left(  \hat
{a}_{2},\hat{b}_{2},\hat{c}_{2}\right)  $ in $3$-dimensional euclidean space
depends only on the dot products of the two vectors with themselves and with
each other. Namely%
\[
\theta=\arccos\left(  \frac{\hat{V}_{1}\bullet\hat{V}_{2}%
}{\left\vert \hat{V}_{1}\right\vert \cdot\left\vert \hat{V}_{2}\right\vert
}\right)  .
\]

\end{corollary}

In fact it is also true that the formula for the area of the parallelogram
determined by two vectors $\hat{V}_{1}$ and $\hat{V}_{2}$ depends only on the
dot products of the two vectors with themselves and with each other. You will
see this by answering the following problems.

\begin{problem}
Show that the area of the parallelogram determined by $\hat{V}_{1}$ and
$\hat{V}_{2}$ emanating from the same point in euclidean $3$-space is given by%
\[
|\hat{V}_{1}|\cdot|\hat{V}_{2}|\cdot\sin\theta.
\]
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}
\label{9}Show that the area of the parallelogram determined by $\hat{V}_{1}$
and $\hat{V}_{2}$ emanating from the same point in euclidean $3$-space is also
given by%
\[
\sqrt{\det
\begin{bmatrix}
\hat{V}_{1}\bullet\hat{V}_{1} & \hat{V}_{2}\bullet\hat{V}_{1}\\
\hat{V}_{1}\bullet\hat{V}_{2} & \hat{V}_{2}\bullet\hat{V}_{2}%
\end{bmatrix}}.
\]

\begin{hint}
Start from the square of
$|\hat{V}_{1}|\cdot|\hat{V}_{2}|\cdot\sin\theta$, substitute $\left(
1-\cos^{2}\theta\right)$ for $\sin^{2}\theta$, and use the theorem
above. Alternatively start from
$|\hat{V}_{1}|\cdot|\hat{V}_{2}|\cdot\sin\theta$ and show that%
\[
\sin\left(  \arccos\left(  \frac{\hat{V}_{1}\bullet\hat{V}%
_{2}}{\left\vert \hat{V}_{1}\right\vert \cdot\left\vert \hat{V}_{2}\right\vert
}\right)  \right)  
=\frac{\sqrt{\det
    \begin{bmatrix}
      \hat{V}_{1}\bullet\hat{V}_{1} & \hat{V}_{2}\bullet\hat{V}_{1}\\
      \hat{V}_{1}\bullet\hat{V}_{2} & \hat{V}_{2}\bullet\hat{V}_{2}
    \end{bmatrix}
  }
}{\left\vert\hat{V}_{1}\right\vert \cdot\left\vert
  \hat{V}_{2}\right\vert }.
\]
\end{hint}

\end{problem}

\begin{problem}
Show that we have the following equality of matrices%
\[
\begin{bmatrix}
\hat{V}_{1}\bullet\hat{V}_{1} & \hat{V}_{2}\bullet\hat{V}_{1}\\
\hat{V}_{1}\bullet\hat{V}_{2} & \hat{V}_{2}\bullet\hat{V}_{2}%
\end{bmatrix}
=
\begin{bmatrix}
\hat{V}_{1} \\
\hat{V}_{2}
\end{bmatrix}
\cdot
\begin{bmatrix}
\hat{V}_{1}^\transpose  & \hat{V}_{2}^\transpose 
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

\end{problem}

Again, the significance of the previous problems is that, to compute
areas, we only need to know how to compute dot-products. Hence, it is
the definition of the dot-product of the vectors completely determines
the calculation of the area of the parallelogram they generate.  We
finish this section with one other related fact.

\begin{lemma}
The area of the parallelogram determined by two vectors $\hat{V}_{1}=\left(
\hat{a}_{1},\hat{b}_{1},\hat{c}_{1}\right)  $ and $\hat{V}_{2}=\left(  \hat
{a}_{2},\hat{b}_{2},\hat{c}_{2}\right)  $ emanating from the same point in
euclidean $3$-space is given by the length of the cross-product%
\[
\hat{V}_{1}\times\hat{V}_{2}=\left(
\det\begin{bmatrix}
\hat{b}_{1} & \hat{c}_{1}\\
\hat{b}_{2} & \hat{c}_{2}%
\end{bmatrix},
\det\begin{bmatrix}
\hat{c}_{1} & \hat{a}_{1}\\
\hat{c}_{2} & \hat{a}_{2}%
\end{bmatrix},
\det\begin{bmatrix}
\hat{a}_{1} & \hat{b}_{1}\\
\hat{a}_{2} & \hat{b}_{2}%
\end{bmatrix}
\right).
\]

\end{lemma}

Now we will prove this lemma. Your task is to fill-in the details of
the proof below.

\begin{problem}
We use some facts from linear algebra. First of all, develop the determinant%
\[
\det
\begin{bmatrix}
\hat{V}_{1} \\
\hat{V}_{2} \\
\hat{V}_{1}\times\hat{V}_{2}
\end{bmatrix}
\]
along the third row.
\begin{itemize}
\item Conclude that 
\[
\left\vert
\det
\begin{bmatrix}
\hat{V}_{1} \\
\hat{V}_{2} \\
\hat{V}_{1}\times\hat{V}_{2}
\end{bmatrix}\right\vert
=\left\vert \hat{V}_{1}\times\hat{V}_{2}\right\vert ^{2}
\]
\item On the other hand by developing the left-hand determinant along
  the third row, show that
\[
\det
\begin{bmatrix}
\hat{V}_{1} \\
\hat{V}_{2} \\
\hat{V}_{1}
\end{bmatrix}
=0
\]
\end{itemize}
Hence we conclude that $\hat{V}_{1}$ is perpendicular to
$\hat{V}_{1}\times\hat{V}_{2}$. Similarly $\hat{V}_{2}$ is
perpendicular to $\hat{V}_{1}\times\hat{V}_{2}$. Finally, the absolute
value of the determinant of a $3\times3$ matrix%
\[
\left\vert
\det
\begin{bmatrix}
\hat{V}_{1} \\
\hat{V}_{2} \\
\hat{V}_{1}\times\hat{V}_{2}
\end{bmatrix}
\right\vert
\]
is the volume of the parallelepiped determined by the row vectors of the
matrix. But that volume is%
\[
\left( \left\vert \hat{V}_{1}\right\vert \cdot\left\vert \hat{V}%
_{2}\right\vert \cdot\sin\theta\right)  \cdot\left\vert \hat{V}%
_{1}\times\hat{V}_{2}\right\vert
\]
since $\left(  \left\vert \hat{V}_{1}\right\vert \cdot\left\vert \hat{V}%
_{2}\right\vert \cdot\sin\theta\right)  $ is the area of the base
of the parallelepiped and $\hat{V}_{1}\times\hat{V}_{2}$ is perpendicular to
both $V_{1}$ and $V_{2}$. So we see
\[
\left(  \left\vert \hat{V}_{1}\right\vert \cdot\left\vert \hat{V}%
_{2}\right\vert \cdot\sin\theta\right)  \cdot\left\vert \hat{V}%
_{1}\times\hat{V}_{2}\right\vert =\left\vert
\det\begin{bmatrix}
\hat{V}_{1} \\
\hat{V}_{2} \\
\hat{V}_{1}\times\hat{V}_{2}
\end{bmatrix}
\right\vert =\left\vert \hat{V}_{1}\times\hat{V}_{2}\right\vert ^{2}.
\]
So%
\[
\left(  \left\vert \hat{V}_{1}\right\vert \cdot\left\vert \hat{V}%
_{2}\right\vert \cdot\sin\theta\right)  =\left\vert \hat{V}%
_{1}\times\hat{V}_{2}\right\vert .
\]
%[DS,42-47]
\begin{itemize}
\item Explain how this completes the proof. 
\end{itemize}
\end{problem}


\subsection*{Curves in euclidean $3$-space and vectors tangent to them}

\begin{definition}
A \textbf{smooth curve in }$\mathbf{3}$\textbf{-dimensional euclidean space}
is given by a differentiable mapping%
\begin{gather*}
\hat{X}:\left[  b,e\right]  \rightarrow\mathbb{R}^{3}\\
t\mapsto\left(  \hat{x}\left(  t\right)  ,\hat{y}\left(  t\right)  ,\hat
{z}\left(  t\right)  \right)
\end{gather*}
from an interval $\left[ b,e\right] $ on the real line. We shall
sometimes use the notation%
\[
\left(  \hat{x}\left(  t\right)  ,\hat{y}\left(  t\right)  ,\hat{z}\left(
t\right)  \right)  =\hat{X}\left(  t\right)  .
\]
The mapping $\hat{X}\left(  t\right)  $ must have the additional property that
the tangent vector
\[
\left(  \hat{a}\left(  t\right)  ,\hat{b}\left(  t\right)  ,\hat{c}\left(
t\right)  \right)  =\left(  \frac{d\hat{x}}{dt},\frac{d\hat{y}}{dt}%
,\frac{d\hat{z}}{dt}\right)  =\frac{d\hat{X}}{dt}%
\]
is not the zero vector for any $t$ in $\left[ b,e\right] $.
\end{definition}

\begin{problem}\hfil
\begin{enumerate}
\label{1}\item Give two examples of smooth curves,
\begin{align*}
\hat{X}_{1}\left(  s\right)   &  =\left(  \hat{x}_{1}\left(  s\right)
,\hat{y}_{1}\left(  s\right)  ,\hat{z}_{1}\left(  s\right)  \right) \\
\hat{X}_{2}\left(  t\right)   &  =\left(  \hat{x}_{2}\left(  t\right)
,\hat{y}_{2}\left(  t\right)  ,\hat{z}_{2}\left(  t\right)  \right)
\end{align*}
neither of which is a straight line, in $3$-dimensional euclidean space. Do
this so that the two curves pass through a common point and go in distinct
tangent directions at that point. Please choose curves so that none of the
coordinate functions of $s$ or $t$ is a constant function. [DS,71ff]

\item Compute the tangent vectors of each of the two curves at each of their points.

\item For the two curves you defined in a), what are the coordinates of the point
in euclidean $3$-space at which the two curves intersect?

\item Use the dot product formula to compute the angle $\theta$ between (the
tangent vectors to) your two example curves in a) at the point at which the
curves intersect. [DS,20-21]
\end{enumerate}
\end{problem}

Sometimes displacement is measured by showing how a given point is displaced,
as in%
\[
\hat{V}=\hat{X}_{2}-\hat{X}_{1}=\left(  \hat{x}_{2}-\hat{x}_{1},\hat{y}%
_{2}-\hat{y}_{1},\hat{z}_{2}-\hat{z}_{1}\right)  ,
\]
and sometimes displacement is expressed as the instantaneous velocity of a
point moving along a curve as in%
\[
\hat{V}=\frac{d\hat{X}\left(  t\right)  }{dt}=\left(  \frac{d\hat{x}\left(
t\right)  }{dt},\frac{d\hat{y}\left(  t\right)  }{dt},\frac{d\hat{z}\left(
t\right)  }{dt}\right)  .
\]
[DS,30ff].

In matrix notation we can think of
\[
\hat{X}_{2}-\hat{X}_{1}=\left(  \hat{x}_{2}-\hat{x}_{1},\hat{y}_{2}-\hat
{y}_{1},\hat{z}_{2}-\hat{z}_{1}\right)
\]
as a $1\times3$ matrix $\left[\hat{X}_{2}-\hat{X}_{1}\right]$. Then we can
write the formula for the distance between two points $\hat{X}_{1}$ and
$\hat{X}_{2}$ in euclidean $3$-space in terms of the dot-product%
\begin{equation}
d\left(  \hat{X}_{1},\hat{X}_{2}\right)  =\sqrt{\left(  \hat{X}_{2}-\hat
{X}_{1}\right)  \bullet\left(  \hat{X}_{2}-\hat{X}_{1}\right)  } \label{13}%
\end{equation}
or in terms of the matrix product%
\[
d\left( \hat{X}_{1},\hat{X}_{2}\right) =\sqrt{\left[
  \hat{X}_{2}-\hat{X}_{1} \right] \cdot\left[\hat{X}_{2}-\hat{X}%
  _{1}\right]^\transpose }.
\]


\subsection*{Length of a smooth curve in euclidean $3$-space}

\begin{problem}
Compute the length of the tangent vector
\[
\l(t)=\sqrt{\frac{d\hat{X}}{dt}\bullet\frac{d\hat{X}}{dt}}%
\]
to each of your two example curves in the previous problem at each of
their points.
\end{problem}

\begin{definition}
The length $L$ of the curve $\hat{X}(t)$, $t\in[b,e] $, in euclidean
$3$-space is obtained by integrating the length of the tangent vector
to the curve, that is,%
\[
L=\int_{b}^{e} \l(t)  \,dt.
\]
[DS,82] Notice that the length of any curve only depends on the definition of
the dot-product. That is, if we know the formula for the dot-product, we know
(the formula for) the length of any curve.
\end{definition}

Our first example is the path%
\begin{align*}
\left(  \hat{x}\left(  t\right)  ,\hat{y}\left(  t\right)  ,\hat{z}\left(
t\right)  \right)   &  =\left(  R\cdot \sin\left(  t\right)  ,0,R\cdot
\cos\left(  t\right)  \right) \label{6}\\
0\,  &  \leq t\leq\pi.
\end{align*}


Notice that this path lies on the sphere of radius $R$.

\begin{problem}
Write the formula for the tangent vector to the path above at each
point using
$\left(\hat{x}(t),\hat{y}(t),\hat{z}(t)\right)$-coordinates. Show that
the length of this path is $R\pi$.
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}
Compute the length of each of your two example curves in the previous
problem.
\end{problem}

\begin{remark}
In this last problem, you may easily be confronted with an integral
that you cannot compute. For example, if your curve $\hat{X}_{1}\left(
t\right) $ happens to describe an ellipse that is not circular, it was
proved in the 19th century that no formula involving only the
standard functions from calculus will give you the length of your path
from a fixed beginning point to a variable ending point on the
ellipse. If that kind of thing occurs, go back and change the
definitions of your curves in the previous problem until you get two
curves for which you can compute length of your path from a fixed
beginning point to a fixed ending point. [DS,81-82]
\end{remark}




We want to extend such ideas to objects like spheres
\[
\left\{  \left(  \hat{x},\hat{y},\hat{z}\right)  \in\mathbb{R}^{3}:\hat{x}%
^{2}+\hat{y}^{2}+\hat{z}^{2}=R^{2}\right\}
\]
of a fixed radius $R$, since these can be faithfully represented in
ordinary euclidean three-space.  However, there is one disconcerting
fact: As $R$ approaches infinity, the geometry of the $R$-sphere at
any point looks more and more like plane geometry, but on the other
hand, that `limit' plane geometry is `out at infinity.' 

To study all the two-dimensional geometries, including plane geometry
and the hyperbolic geometries, in a uniform way we will have to
\textit{change} the coordinate system we use, or, what will turn out
to be the same thing, we will have to change the distance formula
slightly for each geometry. In fact this means we will change
coordinates.  These new coordinates will be chosen to keep the north
and south poles from going to infinity as the radius $R$ of a sphere
increases without bound. This change of viewpoint will eventually let
us go non-euclidean or, in the language of Buzz Lightyear ``to
infinity and beyond.'' The idea will be like the change from
rectangular to polar coordinates for the plane that you encountered in
calculus, only easier.
